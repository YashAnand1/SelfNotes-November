## 🪐 **Overview** 🪐 
</div>


Greetings from the 1st November of 2023 and welcome to my self-documentation repository which I have set up in order to closely track my everyday office activities in November. 

| **Please note that the updates added to this repository are for my own reference for helping me monitor my own upskilling. However, I do plan on sharing them in case it is required for me to share my day's contribution in detail.** |
|----------|

This document is to act like a log of my daily contributions towards work during my time at office. Though the daily updates will be written for my own self-reference, they can also be used as a reference for others who may want to look into the contributions that I have made per day. These updates will be used to systematically log my assignments, accomplishments, and minute information related to command executions.

## 🪵 **Declaration of Logs** 🪵 
</div>

The daily updates or logs will be written everyday and pushed to this repository using Git. In case of missed updates, I will be trying to publish them the next day. 

These logs can be accessed by going through the index provided in this repository. For reference, these daily logs will also be attached with the daily updates mails that are sent from my side to my Team Leader.
